# Average Calculator Rust
# Overview
Average Calculator is a simple Rust program designed to calculate the average, weighed average, standard deviation, highest and lowest values of a set of user-inputed floating point numbers. 
# Features
Calculations:
- [x] Average
- [x] Weighed Average
- [x] Standard Deviation

Data aquisition:
- [] Highest value
- [] Lowest value
- [x] Get all inputed values
- [x] Get all inputed weights
- [x] Get number of inputs
- [] Read values from file
- [] Read weights from file
# Installing and Running

### Running on Linux/MacOS

### Running on Windows

# Why
Just an overkill way of implementing a simple calculator for an Introduction to Computer Science class.
# Usage
